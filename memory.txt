Here's how ConversationBufferMemory() works:

It stores the entire conversation history. With each new interaction, it appends the latest exchange to the existing history and includes the entire history in the prompt sent to the LLM.
This approach has scalability limitations. As the conversation grows, the prompt size increases, eventually hitting the LLM's token limit.

Here's how the ConversationalSummaryMemory() works:

Instead of storing the entire conversationnb, it maintains a summary of the conversation over time.  With each new interaction, it updates the summary by incorporating the latest exchange.  This summary, rather than the full history, is then included in the prompt sent to the LLM.

This approach addresses the scalability issues of ConversationBufferMemory(). By using a summary, the prompt size remains relatively constant, even as the conversation grows.  However, it does introduce a potential loss of detail, as the LLM only has access to the summarized version of the conversation, not the full verbatim history.  The quality of the summary is crucial to the effectiveness of this memory type.
